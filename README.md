# Wordle-In-Python
wordle in python ?!

alright so
this repository holds the .py file to a game I recreated called Wordle, in which is owned by the Times New York Magazines, and I created it using Python and some
of its many packages such as colorama, english word dictionary, tabulate, random, etc. The game is played directly inside of your terminal when you run the file.
Not only does this file play Wordle in its usual form such as the one in the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html, but it also has a few other extra gimmicks to go with in which make
the game a little more fun and granular.
